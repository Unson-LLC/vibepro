# VibePro Story Refactor

## Purpose

Use this Skill when VibePro is driving a refactor. The goal is to find and fix code defects, security risks, DRY gaps, and responsibility-boundary problems while preserving Story / Architecture / Spec consistency.

## When to Use

Use this Skill when a refactor, cleanup, bug fix, architecture correction, security hardening, performance refactor, UI modernization, or DRY pass is expected to move through VibePro. It applies even when the user asks for "just a small refactor" if the work changes behavior, boundaries, user flows, verification, or PR readiness.

## Required Workflow

1. Start from a Story. If no Story exists, run `vibepro story derive` and inspect the Story map before implementing.
2. Resolve the output language from `.vibepro/config.json` `output.language` or the explicit CLI `--language` override before manually adding or editing human-facing Story, Architecture, Spec, Task, Review, Diagnosis, Journey, or PR artifacts.
3. Check Architecture. If the boundary, dependency direction, or responsibility split is missing, restore or add Architecture docs before changing code.
4. Check Spec. If behavior, invariant, API, or data-flow expectations are missing, restore or add Spec docs before changing code.
5. Use VibePro task context:
   - `vibepro story plan <repo>`
   - `vibepro task create <repo> --from-plan --id <story-id>`
   - `vibepro task brief|plan|handoff <repo> --task <task-id> --id <story-id>`
6. Use a diagnosis package when the refactor has a clear purpose:
   - UI behavior: `vibepro check ui <repo> --story-id <story-id>`
   - Security boundary: `vibepro check security <repo> --story-id <story-id>`
   - Performance readiness: `vibepro check performance <repo> --story-id <story-id>`
   - Architecture boundary: `vibepro check architecture <repo> --story-id <story-id>`
   - Launch readiness: `vibepro check launch-readiness <repo> --story-id <story-id>`
7. For performance refactors, define Story-level metrics before claiming improvement. Separate DB/server readiness from user-perceived readiness.
8. For UI/UX modernization refactors, derive design constraints before changing components:
   - run `vibepro design-modernize derive-system <repo> --id <story-id> ...`,
   - run `vibepro design-modernize plan <repo> --id <story-id> ...`,
   - preserve current routes, information architecture, CTA priority, state behavior, and data dependencies,
   - treat image-generated or external design proposals as visual hypotheses, not implementation authority.
9. Implement with focused tests. Prefer small changes tied to the task target files.
10. Run project verification and then `vibepro pr prepare`.
11. Read `pr-prepare.json` `gate_status` before treating the work as PR-ready.
12. If Agent Review Gate is unresolved, it must be cleared before finalizing. Treat the generated review plan as an instruction to dispatch Codex/Claude Code subagents when the coordinator runtime provides subagent capability. Do not convert it into a user-permission wait or silently skip it.
13. Run the VibePro parallel subagent review workflow:
   - `vibepro review prepare <repo> --id <story-id> --stage <stage>`
   - dispatch each role in `parallel-dispatch.md` as a separate parallel subagent review,
   - close/shutdown each review subagent after receiving its result,
   - `vibepro review record` each result with Codex/Claude Code provenance and lifecycle evidence (`--agent-system codex|claude_code --execution-mode parallel_subagent --agent-id <id> --agent-closed` plus thread/session/call/transcript evidence),
   - rerun `vibepro pr prepare`.
   If the runtime cannot spawn subagents, block or record a human waiver decision; manual review records do not satisfy required Agent Review Gate.
14. Use the review cockpit to decide whether to proceed, split, add evidence, waive with reason, or block.

## Refactor Target Criteria

Prioritize candidates that VibePro surfaces as:

- security boundary or authorization risk
- duplicated query, validation, or policy shape
- responsibility split failure
- Story / Architecture / Spec contradiction
- Graphify-related impact beyond changed files
- Gate evidence missing for changed behavior

## Guardrails

- Do not refactor only because code looks untidy. Tie the work to Story value and evidence.
- Do not widen scope after `task handoff` unless `pr prepare` confirms the scope remains reviewable.
- Do not mix repo-control changes, requirement SSOT recovery, runtime behavior, and E2E gate fixes unless the split-plan allows it.
- Do not treat `scope.status=reviewable` as completion approval. It is PR size/scope guidance only.
- Do not merge or create a PR unless `gate_status.ready_for_pr_create=true` and `gate_status.overall_status=ready_for_review`.
- Do not waive critical unresolved Gates with a reason alone. Critical Gates require evidence closure or a split/block decision.
- Do not call a VibePro refactor complete while `gate:agent_review` is `needs_review`, `missing`, `stale`, `block`, or `failed`; complete the parallel subagent reviews first.
- Do not satisfy Agent Review Gate with a manual `pass`. A passing review must include Codex or Claude Code parallel subagent provenance and closed lifecycle evidence (`--agent-closed`) so later audits can distinguish real subagent review from coordinator self-approval and closed review threads.
- Do not treat visual redesign as a refactor unless the unchanged UX contracts are explicit. Current route, layout information hierarchy, CTA priority, state behavior, data dependencies, and accessibility expectations must be preserved or intentionally changed in Story/Spec.
- Do not use color-token substitution as a substitute for a Design System. VibePro-derived DS should include semantic colors, state colors, component roles, CTA hierarchy, composition rules, anti-patterns, and visual hypothesis policy.
- Do not translate machine-facing identifiers while localizing human-facing artifacts. Keep JSON keys, schema names, enums, Story IDs, Gate IDs, DAG node IDs, task IDs, role IDs, commands, file paths, package names, and external tool names unchanged.
- Do not claim VibePro managed worktree execution exists just because Story / Spec / Architecture documents describe the planned DAG. Until `vibepro execute start` actually creates or reuses a worktree and records that state, use a normal git worktree manually when isolation is needed.
- Do not clean dirty repository worktrees by reflexively stashing. First inspect `git status --short --branch`, unstaged diff, cached diff, and branch/HEAD reflog.
- If a branch was advanced by external sync, merge, rebase, or another worktree, check whether the dirty state is a stale reverse diff from the previous branch commit to `HEAD`. Compare `git diff --stat <old> HEAD` with `git diff --cached --stat` / `git diff --stat` before deciding.
- Only classify dirty state as safe to clean after proving it is already represented in `HEAD` and contains no extra user hunks. Otherwise report the exact files and keep the work intact.

## Common Rationalizations

- "This is only refactoring, so Story/Spec do not matter." Reject this; refactors can change contracts and must preserve or update the documented intent.
- "No UI changed, so no user-facing evidence is needed." API, data, performance, and operational behavior can still affect users.
- "A broad cleanup is efficient." VibePro favors scope that remains reviewable and tied to the Story.
- "Agent Review can wait until after final." If the Gate requires it, unresolved review means the work is not complete.
- "Design modernization is just visual polish." It must preserve routes, information architecture, CTA priority, states, data dependencies, and accessibility unless the Story/Spec intentionally change them.

## Red Flags

- The refactor starts from code edits without identifying the Story.
- Architecture or Spec gaps are discovered but left implicit.
- Verification only proves the happy path or only the changed file.
- A split-plan recommends separation but the implementation keeps unrelated lanes together.
- Performance claims lack comparable before/after metrics.
- UI modernization lacks derived DS and DS gate evidence.

## Verification

Before calling the refactor complete, show that Story, Architecture, and Spec still align; run focused project verification for changed behavior; run the relevant diagnosis package; rerun `vibepro pr prepare`; and inspect `gate_status`, `gate:definition_of_done`, `gate:agent_review`, and the review cockpit decision path.

## Completion Check

Before calling the work done:

- Story / Architecture / Spec relationship is clear.
- Tests or verification evidence exists for changed behavior.
- Purpose-level diagnosis package evidence exists when UI, security, performance, architecture, or launch readiness was the stated goal.
- UI modernization has `derived-design-system.json`, `design-modernize.json`, and `ds-gate.json` evidence when the Story changes design/UX.
- Performance improvements have comparable before/after evidence, or the PR explicitly says improvement rate is unknown and why.
- `pr-prepare.json` `gate_status.ready_for_pr_create` is true.
- `gate:agent_review` has passed when VibePro required parallel subagent review.
- `review-cockpit.html` has a clear recommended decision.
- `human-review.json` can record the human decision.
- `vibepro pr create` is the PR creation path.
